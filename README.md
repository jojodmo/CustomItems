### CustomItems is a highly customizable, easy to use plugin that allows you to add custom items and blocks with new textures to your Minecraft server, and add custom recipes and triggers for both your custom items and Minecraft items. CustomItems even hooks into Skript, so you can write your own Skripts to run when players do something with your item!
